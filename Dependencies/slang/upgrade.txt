Slang is HEAVILY auto-generated by tools that it first needs to build and then run.
We spent a lot of time trying to port this workflow to Premake…
In the end we just decided to say screw it and take the auto generated files and put them in slang/generated (for the includes) and slang/source/generated (for the generated files that have .cpp files that need to get built, this gets built by the Slang-Slang project).
We also have a function in slang.lua which does a one time cleanup after upgrading versions.

Upgrading this is probably gonna suck and involve CMake generating in a separate folder, finding the files you need and copying them over.
Talk to Pursche for support, both actual and emotional.
